                <h3>About Ava</h3>
                    <p>
                    Ava was born in Toledo, Ohio - and after traveling all the way around the world, she's landed back in Archbold. For now.<br>
                    Having always had an appreciation for foreign languages and cultures, Ava studied Foreign Language Education at the
                    <span class="schools">University of Toledo</span>, concentrating in German. In an interesting twist, this led her to become an English teacher in Japan
                    (because, you know, that makes sense). Now though, she's left the education field, working a blue-collar
                    job while she studies computer programming at <span class="schools">Northwest State Community College</span>.

                <h3>Her Travels</h3>
                    <p>
                    During her travels, Ava has visited 8 countries on two different continents. Her first trip abroad was to
                    Germany, where she studied abroad for an academic year at  <span class="schools">Leuphana University</span> in <strong>Lüneburg</strong>.
                    She also did a summer abroad near the city of <strong>Göttingen</strong>, where she did volunteer work in a refugee camp.<br>
                    Ava's next venture overseas came after graduating college, when she joined the Japan Exchange and Teaching (JET) Program as an
                    Assistant Language Teacher. She was stationed in <strong>Tokushima</strong>, one of the most remote regions of the country.
                    For three years she had a home among the beautiful mountain landscape there, teaching at <span class="schools">Johoku Senior High School</span> and
                    <span class="schools">Tokushima Prefectural High School of Science and Technology</span> (SciTechHi).

                <h3>Her Hobbies</h3>
                    <p>
                    Ava is in no way social, so she has to have many hobbies to fill up her free time. Her biggest passion is story telling, and
                    she hopes to publish a dystopian fiction series someday. In addition to writing, she also enjoys arts and crafts, specifically
                    woodburning. Her pieces often incorporate mystical elements such as tarot cards, crystals, and woodland critters.<br>
